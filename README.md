# simulife

Simulife is a web application which is going to attempt to "simulate" a human
life with as much detail as possible. The player will create a character and
make decisions and take actions as that character from birth to the end of the
character's life.

Through early childhood and school, life after high school,
going into the workforce, and retiring; there will be lots of potential for
the development of the player's character in terms of their relationships,
belongings, responsibilities, and random events.
